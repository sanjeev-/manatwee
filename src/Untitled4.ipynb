She would have had an even tougher time with Getty.\\u201cAll the Money in the World\\u201d is a story of towering greed and the absence of mercy, and an ideal 21st century morality tale. It\\u2019s about money and families and the ties that bind and cut, although because it was directed by Ridley Scott there isn\\u2019t a jot of sentimentalism gumming the works. In July 1973, John Paul Getty III (known as Paul), the elder Getty\\u2019s 16-year-old grandson, was snatched off a street in Rome. His kidnappers demanded $17 million in ransom, telling Paul\\u2019s mother, \\u201cGet it from London.\\u201d It was a reference to Getty Sr., who in turn responded, \\u201cIf I pay one penny now, I\\u2019ll have 14 kidnapped grandchildren,\\u201d a kiss-off heard around the world.Mr. Scott sets the scene quickly with a somewhat phantasmagoric meander through Rome\\u2019s crowded streets. It\\u2019s night, and pretty, boyish Paul (Charlie Plummer) is savoring la dolce vita, floating past the city\\u2019s flesh and marble beauties and its swarms of catcalling, hustling paparazzi. There\\u2019s sensuousness to Paul\\u2019s drift, which, as the camera silkily slips alongside him, suggests a casual luxurious attitude toward life, of being free to do anything, go anywhere, say anything. He\\u2019s kissed by fortune but also by youth. And when a streetwalker calls him baby and he smiles, you see just how young. Within seconds he\\u2019s been kidnapped.\\u201cAll the Money in the World\\u201d revs up beautifully, first as a thriller. But while the kidnapping is the movie\\u2019s main event, it is only part of a story that is, by turns, a sordid, desperate and anguished tragedy about money. When Paul is kidnapped, Getty Sr. (Christopher Plummer) has already amassed a fortune, one partly pumped out of oil fields both in the United States and in the Middle East. (The Plummers are not related.) He lives alone in crepuscular gloom in Sutton Place, a manor house built by a favorite courtier of Henry VIII. There, amid miles of rooms adorned with gilt-framed masterworks, Getty Sr. closely monitors the stock information on the disgorging ticker tape that\\u2019s both his leash and lifeline.Mr. Scott is a virtuoso of obsession, of men and women possessed. He likes darkness, pictorially and of the soul, and in Getty Sr. he has a magnificent specimen. And in Mr. Plummer he has a great actor giving a performance with a singular asterisk: In early November, with the movie already done, Mr. Scott hired Mr. Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of sexual misconduct. It was a bold move, an extreme variation on leaving a performance on the cutting-room floor. The 88-year-old Mr. Plummer isn\\u2019t fully persuasive when briefly playing the younger Getty Sr., even in long shot. But his performance is so dominating, so magnetic and monstrous that it doesn\\u2019t matter.Like many contemporary movies, this one kinks up its timeline. After Paul is kidnapped, the scene shifts to Saudi Arabia in 1948, where Getty Sr. is laying the foundation for an even greater fortune. Written by David Scarpa \\u2014 working from John Pearson\\u2019s 1995 book \\u201cPainfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortune and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty\\u201d \\u2014 the movie continues to jump around, filling in the back story while deepening the atmosphere and gathering the dramatis personae. One intimate scene takes place in the 1960s, where Paul\\u2019s mother, Gail (Michelle Williams, warmth incarnate), and father, Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), are going broke with four boisterous young children.By the time Paul is kidnapped, his nuclear family has imploded; Getty Jr. is lost in an opium cloud and Gail is living in Rome. Much of the movie involves the drama of the kidnapping, which unfolds in separate, increasingly tightly woven-together lines of action. Taken by a ragtag criminal gang, Paul is stashed in a desolate farmhouse, where his closest keeper becomes Cinquanta (Romain Duris, a charismatically feral presence). In Rome, Gail struggles with the kidnappers, police and paparazzi while trying to interest Getty Sr. in his grandson. Getty Sr. continues counting out his money, only reluctantly calling in the cavalry, a security specialist, Fletcher (a very fine Mark Wahlberg).Mr. Scott conjures up entire worlds and sensibilities with visual precision, adding detail even when going for sweep. Each new scene adds another layer of meaning, thickening the slow-building sense of dread: the men in billowing white robes on oil-rich land waiting for Getty Sr., a master of the universe who arrives in a demonically belching train. Gail and Getty Jr., anxiously presenting their young family to Getty Sr. like paupers bowing down before the lord of the realm. As the story shifts from farmhouse to manor, from the kidnappers to Getty Sr. (each side armed, impatient, brutal), a parallelism develops and it becomes clear that he took his family hostage long before the kidnapping.Mr. Plummer can be an aloof, fairly cool screen presence and he chills Getty Sr. with cruel glints, funereal insinuation and a controlled, withholding physicality. A lot of actors soften their heavies, as if nervously asserting their own humanity. With Mr. Scott, Mr. Plummer instead creates a rapacious man whose hunger for wealth and power (and more money, always more) has hollowed him out and whose fatherly touch, at its most consuming, brings to mind Goya\\u2019s painting of Saturn eating his son. The horror of Getty Sr. is that he is never less than human, but that he\\u2019s hoarded everything, including every last vestige of love, for himself. It\\u2019s a magnificent portrait of self-annihilation.At one point in the movie, Getty Sr. does pull out his wallet, buying a masterpiece while Paul continues to languish with his kidnappers, an ordeal that grows more frightening and byzantine as the clock winds down. Gail and Fletcher are struggling to free Paul, an effort that finds them often grappling with Getty Sr. His interest in Paul rises and falls, much like the stock market does. He has become famous for his status as the wealthiest man in the world, prominence that he clings to, much like his money. He has filled his manor house with priceless objects, turning statues and paintings into fetishes. He has earned so much, spent so much and, in doing so, insured that he and everyone else have lost.',\n",

       "  'text': u'Kim Yong-hwa\\u2019s delirious fantasy \\u201cAlong With the Gods: The Two Worlds\\u201d is a harmless romp flirting at profundity without coming close. But it certainly offers plenty to occupy the eye. Rarely has a director so reveled in the possibilities of digital effects (with the exception of Robert Rodriguez during his \\u201cAdventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\\u201d period). That said, story clarity and emotional depth tend to evaporate amid the visual pyrotechnics.The story, adapted from a web comic by Joo Ho-min, concerns an earnest, heroic firefighter (Cha Tae-hyun) who, when he is killed in the line of duty, becomes a candidate for reincarnation. But first he must face seven judges in the afterlife who review key moments in his existence. Fortunately he is represented by three guardians (Ha Jung-woo, Ju Ji-hoon and the charming actress Kim Hyang-gi) who defend his eligibility. En route to these celestial magistrates, the four pass through perilous realms with names like the Volcano of the Damned, Murder Hell and the Blade Forest, battling the computer-animated likes of toothy fish with humanoid heads and so-called hell ghouls, with glowing red weapons vaguely resembling light sabers.Greatly complicating matters is a subplot about the firefighter\\u2019s soldier brother, whose death at the hands of another trooper is covered up, turning the brother into a malevolent spirit. But all is forgiven in a riot of tearful Hallmark sentimentality that Mr. Kim has the good sense to gently pillory. It all proves exasperating, and yet, yes, a sequel is teased at the end.',\n",

       "  'text': u'With the buddy-cop fantasy \\u201cBright,\\u201d Will Smith and the director David Ayer attempt to chart new territory: an urban action film populated not only by humans but also fantastical creatures like centaurs, fairies, orcs and elves. (If you\\u2019re unfamiliar with orcs, check your J. R. R. Tolkien.) The result is a loud, ungainly hybrid that does not serve police procedurals or fantasy spectaculars very well.Written by Max Landis (whose scripts for \\u201cMr. Right\\u201d and the BBC series \\u201cDirk Gently\\u2019s Holistic Detective Agency\\u201d have also crossbred genres), \\u201cBright\\u201d wastes little time with nettlesome back story about how mythological beings entered our present.

Daryl resents Nick for having fumbled an arrest that left Daryl sidelined for weeks, and, like many of his colleagues, he also distrusts Nick, the first orc hired by the department. (The racism metaphor is entirely intentional. There\\u2019s even a slur: pigface.)In fact, a small cadre of corrupt officers wants Nick eliminated. And a new threat arrives: Leilah (a hammy yet almost silent Noomi Rapace), a lethal elf serving a malevolent entity called, yes, the Dark Lord. Leilah is after Tikka (Lucy Fry), an elf who has taken possession of a glowing magic wand emitting great destructive energy. When Daryl and Nick (who speaks Elvish) take Tikka under their protection, the three are pursued not only by cops but also by Leilah and her ruthless cronies; a Latino street gang after the wand, led by the nasty Poison (Enrique Murciano); and operatives of a federal Magic Task Force (Edgar Ramirez and Happy Anderson).

After consulting with the vinegary Scotland Yard hand Chief Inspector Taverner (Terence Stamp, always welcome), Charles sets out to the estate, filled with aunts, sons, in-laws and others, embodied by an all-star cast including Glenn Close, Julian Sands, Gillian Anderson and Christina Hendricks.

       "  'text': u'One of my favorite movies of 2017, \\u201cWar for the Planet of the Apes,\\u201d posited near-total human extinction as a more-or-less happy ending. A radically dystopian future seems like the best we deserve these days, and it was impressive to see a summer blockbuster offer such harsh medicine.Alexander Payne\\u2019s new movie, \\u201cDownsizing,\\u201d doesn\\u2019t go nearly as far. Surveying a landscape of impending ecological catastrophe, it proposes a future that is only mildly dystopian and prescribes laughter rather than apocalyptic despair as, if not exactly a remedy, then at least an acceptable palliative. We don\\u2019t need to disappear altogether, but it might be better all around if we weren\\u2019t so darn big.Mr. Payne\\u2019s title refers not to corporate cost-saving strategies but to a technological procedure invented by scientists in Norway and adapted for universal, commercial use. People are efficiently and almost painlessly shrunk to around four or five inches. This is sold as an environmental panacea: Our tiny selves will take less of a toll on the earth\\u2019s resources and produce less waste. The burden we impose on our hot, crowded planet is expected to decrease proportionally.But Mr. Payne is a canny student of modern American culture and in particular of the ways his fellow citizens conflate selfishness and virtue. The real attraction in becoming small isn\\u2019t that you consume less; it\\u2019s that you can have a whole lot more. That\\u2019s what Paul and Audrey Safranek, an Omaha couple played by Matt Damon and Kristen Wiig, discover. Compared with their regular-size lives of compromised dreams and diminished expectations, downsizing promises luxury and abundance. Once they liquidate their modest assets, they can move into a mansion in a planned community called Leisureland and pursue a guilt-free vision of material happiness. The hard sell is provided, at a surreal seminar, by Neil Patrick Harris and Laura Dern. What could go wrong?Mr. Payne, who wrote \\u201cDownsizing\\u201d with his frequent collaborator Jim Taylor, zooms in on the fine print in the contract \\u2014 in other words, on the ways our ingrained fallibility upends our utopian projects. Paul, having undergone the irreversible (and hilariously detailed) reduction, finds himself unexpectedly alone in Leisureland. The world of \\u201cthe small\\u201d \\u2014 who are somehow both an oppressed minority and a privileged elite \\u2014 is afflicted by the usual problems. Selfishness and deceit haven\\u2019t disappeared, and bigger injustices still exist. Paul sees a news report about a political dissident involuntarily made tiny by an oppressive government and later discovers festering inequality around Leisureland itself. Some of the familiar contradictions of 21st-century capitalism are magnified as Paul, a Gulliver gone native in Lilliput, eventually discovers.Mr. Damon\\u2019s regular-guy affability carries the movie through its expository phase, which is a lot of fun. Mr. Payne has an admirably concrete logistical sense and an eye for amusing incongruities. The transition from big to small is full of clever touches, like the spatulas that lift the newly shrunken out of their suddenly oversize beds, as if they were freshly baked one-bite cookies.Paul, big and small, is just interesting enough to be good company. He is friendly, but with that hint of heartland hostility that is layered into every Alexander Payne hero\\u2019s temperament like a smear of hot mustard in a bologna-and-cheese sandwich. Paul\\u2019s passivity gives the movie a leisurely rhythm unusual in both science fiction and satire, the two genres that \\u201cDownsizing\\u201d nods toward without fully embracing.Instead, the movie resembles an episode of \\u201cThe Twilight Zone\\u201d directed by Preston Sturges. An outlandish, pointedly allegorical conceit is inhabited not by symbolic figures but by terrestrial oddballs. You don\\u2019t see this at first, because Mr. Payne is so charmed by the conceit itself. Like a video gamer uninterested in winning and in no hurry to advance to higher levels, he knocks around the corners and side streets of his invented reality, treating it the way he treated Hawaii in \\u201cThe Descendants,\\u201d wine country in \\u201cSideways\\u201d and his beloved Nebraska in most of his other movies \\u2014 as a picturesque, lived-in backdrop for the spectacle of human ridiculousness.About an hour in, \\u201cDownsizing\\u201d amps up that ridiculousness in risky and wonderful fashion. Just when we (along with Paul) assume we\\u2019ve figured out the rules and boundaries of this place, Christoph Waltz shows up as Paul\\u2019s upstairs neighbor, an international man of mystery named Dusan. Shortly thereafter, Paul meets Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who becomes the agent of his ethical and romantic reawakening. For a delirious while, fueled by Mr. Waltz and Ms. Chau\\u2019s zigzagging comic energies, we are transported to a land beyond genre, a zone of pure comic sublimity.And then, with a bit of a thud, this kinetic and good-natured movie discovers its limitations and shrinks before our eyes. Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor, roaming freely in their conjoined imaginations, wander off into the bushes and then stumble into the middle of the road. Paul\\u2019s journey loses direction and momentum, and sour, nagging questions begin to intrude. Haven\\u2019t we seen this story before, in which a white man\\u2019s anomie is cured by the love of an exotic woman? Did we come all this way to rediscover the ouroboros of guilty liberal self-consciousness?Well, yes, as it turns out. But then again the whole point of the movie is the scaling down of expectations to arrive at something like an accurate sense of scale, and disappointment may be a perverse sign of success. \\u201cDownsizing\\u201d is an ambitious movie about the value of modesty, and its faults are proportionate to its insights. I sort of wish it felt like a bigger deal, but maybe that\\u2019s my problem.',\n",

       "  'text': u'In light of a r\\xe9sum\\xe9 skewed toward male-dominated thrillers, the Scottish director Paul McGuigan might seem an unlikely choice to guide a fading-siren weepie from page to screen. Yet \\u201cFilm Stars Don\\u2019t Die in Liverpool,\\u201d a real-life romance adapted from the 1986 memoir by Peter Turner, reveals an unexpected fontanel of sentiment in Mr. McGuigan\\u2019s style that \\u2014 when not tipping over into bathos \\u2014 can be rather lovely.Unfolding during the final years in the life of the actress Gloria Grahame (who died in 1981), the movie recounts her unlikely last-gasp love affair with Mr. Turner, an English actor. When they met, in a London boardinghouse in 1978, he was 26 and she was almost three decades older, striving to supplement a waning film career with stage roles. Once a major star (she won an Oscar in 1952 for \\u201cThe Bad and the Beautiful\\u201d), Grahame excelled at playing knowingly sultry floozies. Her characters were often equal parts brass and Jell-O \\u2014 a combination that unmanned many a male co-star.Peter (Jamie Bell) is no exception, and the movie\\u2019s early scenes have a wonderful buoyancy as he and Gloria (Annette Bening) effortlessly connect. Hanging out in movie theaters and blue-collar pubs, the two develop a credible chemistry that renders age irrelevant. This atmosphere of playful sexiness fades all too soon, though, when Gloria becomes desperately ill and asks to be cared for by Peter\\u2019s mother, Bella (Julie Walters, at her tart-tongued best), in his childhood home in Liverpool.It\\u2019s a depressingly dreary ending to a tumultuous life. And as briefly luminous scenes in Los Angeles and Manhattan give way to Bella\\u2019s drab council house (whose screeching wallpaper would have sapped anyone\\u2019s will to live), Mr. McGuigan labors to dispel the odor of the grave. Directing with some flair, he employs a zigzagging timeline that gooses Matt Greenhalgh\\u2019s otherwise downbeat screenplay. In tandem with the cinematographer Urszula Pontikos, he makes a virtue of contrivance, emphasizing the artifice of some of the movie\\u2019s sets by, say, having Peter stride seamlessly off a Los Angeles beach and into a Liverpudlian hallway.Tricks like this are a welcome distraction from the story\\u2019s overreliance on pathos, but they\\u2019re not the director\\u2019s only weapon: He also has a talent for constructing stand-alone scenes that inspire us to picture worlds beyond their margins. In one of these, Gloria meets with her British mother and sulkily jealous sister (Vanessa Redgrave and Frances Barber, both perfect), and the encounter spins a handful of lines of dialogue into imagined decades of deep dysfunction.Sinking too quickly from light and bright to sad and soggy, \\u201cFilm Stars\\u201d affords Ms. Bening (who should have easily nabbed an Oscar last year for her sensational work in Mike Mills\\u2019s \\u201c20th Century Women\\u201d) precious few opportunities to enchant. Still, she\\u2019s marvelously mutable, shifting subtly from insecure to prideful and back again as her allure drains and her strength fails.As marvelous as she is, it\\u2019s Mr. Bell who might be the film\\u2019s greatest surprise. Ever since he leapt onto our screens in 2000 as a gawky kid in \\u201cBilly Elliot,\\u201d his opportunities to play a romantic lead have been virtually nil. Which is a pity, because he approaches ardor with a restrained sincerity that encourages us to trust the character. In one pivotal fight scene, filmed from both lovers\\u2019 perspectives, he makes Peter\\u2019s hurt and confusion touchingly real.Landing lightly on the loneliness of fame and the ravages of aging, \\u201cFilm Stars Don\\u2019t Die in Liverpool\\u201d is a fond farewell to a distinctive talent.

       "  'text': u'If you are even only a little familiar with the work of the Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke, it will come as no surprise that he does not regard instant messaging and smartphones as positive developments for humanity. His latest picture, \\u201cHappy End,\\u201d begins with the middle of its wide-screen frame taken up by the perfectly centered image of a phone, its camera eavesdropping on a middle-age woman whose bathroom door is open as she prepares for bed. The unseen voyeur texts snide commentary on the woman\\u2019s routine.Mr. Haneke, whose technical mastery often makes his considered existential dyspepsia easier to swallow, doesn\\u2019t establish an obvious motivation for the spy \\u2014 the 13-year-old Eve, the second-youngest member of the singularly unhappy Laurent family, whose story this movie tells. The Laurents, a most high-bourgeois clan, are besieged by trouble. Its patriarch, Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant), retains some mental sharpness in his 80s, but he\\u2019s losing his memory, and he\\u2019d like to get out \\u2014 that is, die \\u2014 while he still has some faculties left. His son Thomas (Mathieu Kassovitz) has brought his daughter Eve (Fantine Harduin) to stay with him and his new wife and baby after Eve\\u2019s mother attempted suicide. (Thomas also has a mistress, whom Eve learns about while cyber-eavesdropping on her father.) They are all living in the family\\u2019s Calais mansion with Eve\\u2019s aunt, Anne (Isabelle Huppert) \\u2014 she\\u2019s the woman in Eve\\u2019s phone at the beginning \\u2014 who is trying to keep the family construction business afloat, a task not helped much by her wayward son, Pierre (Franz Rogowski), or a fatal accident at a building site.\\u201cHappy End\\u201d has a linear structure, but Mr. Haneke presents his scenes with little or no connective tissue. Instead of conventional transitions, there are abrupt shifts that resemble clicking through channels on a television. A scene of domestic disorder will cut to a web video in which an adolescent boy giddily chronicles his hair and skateboarding styles from videos past, and the movie lets this clip roll on quite a while before showing us that it\\u2019s something Eve is watching on her computer. This strategy has a distancing effect, but also forces the viewer to stay on his or her toes.It also constitutes a bit of misdirection, in that there is a bigger picture outside of this chronicle of self-absorption. The Laurents, as what some would call wealth creators, have, in Mr. Haneke\\u2019s view, some responsibility to and for a whole class of people who aren\\u2019t even abstractions to them. Aside from their servants, members of the working class \\u2014 both the documented and undocumented \\u2014 are not often seen in this movie, but the times they are made visible are significant. They appear at key points in the movie, as when Georges, in a wheelchair after his attempted suicide-by-car fails, rolls down a street, festooned with tacky little shops, and stops in front of a group of men, most likely African immigrants. We can\\u2019t hear what he\\u2019s asking of them, but we can guess. The character\\u2019s presumption is staggering on several levels.Like many of Mr. Haneke\\u2019s films from the past two decades, \\u201cHappy End\\u201d is set in France and features a mostly French-speaking cast. It has an uncommonly strong ensemble cast (including Toby Jones, who plays Anne\\u2019s English lover and business ally), but the movie belongs to Mr. Trintignant. At the height of his career, his nuanced performing mode achieved an almost supernatural perfection, whether he was playing a romantically hapless intellectual (in \\u201cMy Night at Maud\\u2019s,\\u201d released in the United States in 1970), a stoic racecar driver (in \\u201cA Man and a Woman,\\u201d 1966) or a fascist dupe (in \\u201cThe Conformist,\\u201d 1970). Here, he is both steely and vulnerable in a role in which he has almost no physical movements to perform. In the movie\\u2019s central scene, a long conversation with the troubled Eve, he merely has to move his head forward, or crook a finger, to throw a world out of its orbit.',\n",

       "  'text': u'\\u201cHostiles\\u201d opens with a well-traveled observation from D.H. Lawrence about how the \\u201cessential American soul is hard, isolate, stoic and a killer.\\u201d It ends with a shot that complicates that idea by revisiting and in effect reversing a famous image from an earlier western: The last moment of \\u201cThe Searchers,\\u201d when John Wayne lingers outside the door, symbolically barred from entering the civilized society he has saved.In between the explicitly cited Lawrence and the implicitly footnoted Wayne, the action winds from New Mexico to Montana and the modern movie audience is led on a tour of a familiar mythic landscape. Our guide, Scott Cooper, who adapted an unpublished manuscript by the screenwriter Donald E. Stewart into this handsome oater, has updated the talking points to take account of changed sensibilities. The result may not quite be a masterpiece, but it is nonetheless a credible master\\u2019s thesis, a careful and well-informed exploration of the paradoxes that are as integral to the western genre as horses, whiskey and guns. There are plenty of those things, of course, but there is also a conscientious attempt to reckon with the legacy of plunder and racism that flickers behind the legends.Richard Slotkin, at the conclusion of his magisterial three-volume study of the West in the American imagination, notes that the western, appearances to the contrary, doesn\\u2019t have a fixed ideological meaning. We can use the mythology of the frontier, he writes, \\u201cto reify our nostalgia for a falsely idealized past,\\u201d or we can use it as a way of \\u201cimagining and speaking truth.\\u201d \\u201cHostiles\\u201d sets out to do both. It aims for epic grandeur, ethical clarity and also a measure of historical credibility. This puts the movie in a state of contradiction with itself, like nearly every other good western and, for that matter, like the United States of America.It\\u2019s 1892, and the Indian Wars are winding down. Capt. Joseph Blocker (Christian Bale), a walking embodiment of Lawrence\\u2019s archetype, has made a career of genocidal slaughter, which has left him bitter but not remorseful. Blocker is no brute: He reads Julius Caesar in the original Latin. And he hates Indians with a righteous purity that is shocking to contemplate now but was hardly abnormal in those days.To the extent that Blocker has been a soldier doing his job, the movie regards him with sympathy, and supplies an Eastern intellectual (Bill Camp, wearing round spectacles) to sneer and judge. In general, those few white people who speak up in the movie against white brutality are viewed with contempt, even as the agents of that brutality are offered a chance at redemption. The moral economy of \\u201cHostiles\\u201d dictates that only those who have made war can participate in the regenerative violence that leads toward peace.Before he can collect his pension, Blocker is given what for him is a supremely distasteful mission. He must escort one of his old enemies, a dying Cheyenne chief named Yellow Hawk, to his ancestral lands up north. Blocker holds Yellow Hawk (Wes Studi) personally responsible for the deaths of his friends and regards the government\\u2019s decision to set him free after years in captivity to be an intolerable betrayal. But duty is duty, and he gathers up a posse of fine character actors (including Jesse Plemons, Jonathan Majors, Timoth\\xe9e Chalamet and an especially good Rory Cochrane) to accompany the chief and his family (Q\\u2019orianka Kilcher, Adam Beach, Xavier Horsechief and Tanaya Beatty).They are soon joined by Rosalee Quaid (Rosamund Pike), whose family has been slaughtered by Comanches. Her presence allows Blocker to show his compassionate side and alters the relations between the Cheyenne and the soldiers. The existence of a common enemy \\u2014 those Comanches, whose aggression offends both Blocker and Yellow Hawk \\u2014 creates a cautious, tactical alliance that foreshadows a more comprehensive settling of differences.The marauding Comanches are not the only villains. \\u201cHostiles\\u201d is committed to evenhandedness and so introduces some bad white men into the mix. These include a rapacious band of fur trappers and a disgraced soldier (Ben Foster), who faces hanging as punishment for his indiscriminate killing of natives. As he points out, what he is condemned for having done is no different from what Blocker has spent his career doing. Only times and government policies have changed.\\u201cHostiles,\\u201d for all its earnest maneuvering to stay both true to history and on the right side of it, nonetheless sits a bit uncomfortably in the present. It is unlikely to escape notice that this is yet another tale of a white man\\u2019s conscience, which uses Yellow Hawk and his children and grandchildren as vehicles for Blocker\\u2019s awakening. Whether this awakening is complete and whether the film\\u2019s final notes of absolution are fully earned are matters worth arguing about.And \\u201cworth arguing about\\u201d is not a bad verdict. \\u201cHostiles\\u201d is elegantly made, with picturesque cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi and a muscular, old-style score by Max Richter. Mr. Cooper has regained his confidence after the mess of \\u201cBlack Mass.\\u201d The performances are appropriately stoical, and Mr. Bale, Ms. Pike and Mr. Studi share the ability to evoke people from an earlier time without dimming their movie-star charisma.\\u201cHostiles\\u201d itself wants to be both a throwback and an advance, not so much a new kind of western as every possible kind \\u2014 vintage, revisionist, elegiac, feminist. What makes the movie interesting is the sincerity and intelligence with which it pursues that ambition, heroically unaware that the mission is doomed from the start.',\n",

       "  'text': u'\\u201cIn the Fade,\\u201d the new film by Fatih Akin, is divided into three parts. The first two follow a pattern that will be familiar to \\u201cLaw & Order\\u201d fans. A crime is investigated, and then a trial conducted, with a few twists and reversals on the way to the verdict. The emphasis, though, falls less on the procedural aspects of the case than its psychological effects, specifically on Katja Sekerci (Diane Kruger), a German woman whose husband and young son are killed in a bombing in Hamburg.Mr. Akin, whose previous features include the explosive \\u201cHead-On\\u201d and the sprawling, wrenching political melodrama \\u201cThe Edge of Heaven,\\u201d observes his characters and their social environment with a rigorously measured mix of intensity and detachment. Katja, in the days and weeks after the attack, spirals through stages of grief, shock and despair. Surrounded by relatives, friends and in-laws, and visited by pushy, polite detectives, she seems desperately, furiously alone. Because her husband, Nuri (Numan Akar), was a Turkish immigrant and a former drug dealer, the police raise the specters of Islamist terrorism and gang activity. Katja is adamant: \\u201cNazis killed my husband.\\u201d She has the grim satisfaction of being right.If the first section of \\u201cIn the Fade\\u201d provides a series of snapshots of a contemporary German life \\u2014 the hectic pleasures of its big cities; its ambivalent multiculturalism; its bureaucratic humanism \\u2014 the second part zeros in on the gears of the country\\u2019s legal system. Subtlety gives way to blunter characterizations when the two main advocates spar in the courtroom. Katja\\u2019s interests are represented by an old friend (Denis Moschitto), who seems kind and conscientious. The accused murderers, a young married couple, are defended by a tall, bald, sarcastic lawyer (Johannes Krisch) who is perhaps a bit too transparently villainous.But he does succeed in galvanizing the audience\\u2019s disgust, and in reframing the story as a conflict between the desire for justice and the drive for vengeance. This is a venerable theme in movies, driving the plots of most of westerns. In this instance, it carries an extra jolt of political relevance. How should liberal societies deal with homegrown political extremists, who seek protection from the democratic norms and institutions they are committed to destroying? How should the victims of far-right-wing violence fight back?That last question brings about a startling change of scene and tone in the movie\\u2019s final section, which feels like a miniature film noir set in the incongruous sunshine of Greece. But just as \\u201cIn the Fade\\u201d should be reaching its starkest, sharpest point, as Katja\\u2019s pain pushes her toward a moral crisis, Mr. Akin\\u2019s focus seems to waver, and the sense of tough existential clarity that is his greatest virtue goes blurry. The ending is puzzling, when it wants to be devastating, and the political and personal sides of the story, rather than illuminating each other, fight to a stalemate.Ms. Kruger, however, who won the best actress award at Cannes in May, leaves a vivid, haunting impression. Katja, who has already traveled a path from wildness to domestic stability, struggles with the enforced passivity of violent bereavement. With her husband and son gone, the world is dislodged from its axis, and there is nothing Katja can do to set it right again. Dwelling in her sorrow is agonizing, but moving on might be even worse.',\n",

       "  'text': u'Very few remakes, sequels or franchise reboots have signaled their desperation to connect quite as nakedly as \\u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\\u201d does. The movie opens in 1996 with a young man finding the now-discarded board game that wreaked such havoc on its players in the 1995 Robin Williams movie. The game winds up in the room of a teenager who ignores it, because who wants to play a board game? Overnight, the board game magically turns into a video game cartridge. And upon being inserted into the teen\\u2019s console, something strange happens.The movie cuts to the present day and introduces four archetypal, irritating teen characters. There\\u2019s the smart and awkward Spencer; his former best friend \\u201cFridge,\\u201d now a high school football star who makes Spencer do his homework; the selfie-obsessed popular girl, Bethany; and Martha, who\\u2019s a diluted variation of Allison, the smartest and angriest girl in the room in \\u201cThe Breakfast Club.\\u201d And much like in that movie, these kids all get detention together.At first, I presumed that the film\\u2019s increased attention on these teenagers was to make us that much more eager for the stars Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black to show up. There\\u2019s good news and bad news: We meet the marquee names shortly after detention. Only they are portraying those same irritating teen characters.I\\u2019ll explain. The actual teens discover the discarded video game console in the detention room. They plug it in, the game boots up, and the kids choose their characters. Then they get sucked into the game, where they, among other things, meet the fellow who got sucked into the game 20 years before.The movie derives its humor, such as it is, from the teens\\u2019 avatar choices. The nerd gets to be Dwayne Johnson. The big football player gets to be Kevin Hart (who, it is frequently noted, is not tall). The shy, awkward Martha gets to be an expert in dance-fighting (played by Karen Gillan). And the selfie-obsessed girl gets to be, surprise, Jack Black. The crew must navigate a mission that involves a large gem and a villain (Bobby Cannavale) who has insects crawling in and out of his mouth more regularly than is considered normal.Their adventure often asks, \\u201cWhat would Steven Spielberg do?\\u201d It then answers poorly. (The movie\\u2019s director, Jake Kasdan, happens to be the son of Lawrence Kasdan, who worked as a screenwriter with Mr. Spielberg on \\u201cRaiders of the Lost Ark.\\u201d) The performances by Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hart and Mr. Black seem informed by the conviction that if they amuse themselves, they will also amuse others. They are not entirely wrong, but they are also not sufficiently right. Ms. Gillan, the lesser-known quantity of the group, has to work harder as the geeky teen comes to enjoy living, even if temporarily, in a bombshell adult package. She does commendable work both satirizing, and also fulfilling, a sexist conception.',\n",

A poker entrepreneur who ran a high-stakes game before slamming into trouble, Molly is a speed-talker and somewhat of a close one, too.

Her book\\u2019s full title is: \\u201cMolly\\u2019s Game: From Hollywood\\u2019s Elite to Wall Street\\u2019s Billionaire Boys Club, My High-Stakes Adventure in the World of Underground Poker.\\u201dThe movie more or less follows the trajectory laid out by that mouthful of a title, though Mr. Sorkin modestly amends it for dramatic purposes. It begins with an early devastating, life-altering ski-crash that occurs when Molly is an Olympic hopeful. Her slope dreams having come to an end, she postpones law school and moves to Los Angeles. (\\u201cI wanted to be young for a while in warm weather.\\u201d) There, she flops in a friend\\u2019s apartment and ends up working at a club, hustling overpriced vodka to guys who think they\\u2019re players. She catches the eye of one, Dean (Jeremy Strong), who hires her to help run a high-end poker game where the first buy-in is $10,000.The movie takes off once the cards start shuffling. Molly watches and learns, absorbing the game\\u2019s rituals and language while charming the all-male players. She\\u2019s a quick study and a committed Googler, looking up poker terminology and music for gambling away money (Kenny Rogers). With his editors, Mr. Sorkin gives Molly\\u2019s poker education snap, cutting from shot to shot \\u2014 from a drink being poured to a slammed-down stack of chips \\u2014 and turning images into near-hieroglyphics. One of the editors, Alan Baumgarten, worked on David O.

Once Molly has stopped Googling, her entrepreneurial juices start flowing and she realizes that she could be running her own lucrative game. She does, setting one up at a fancy hotel and trading her nice-girl blah for showier makeup, designer threads and deeper d\\xe9colletage. The players follow her, including a major star known only as Player X, who Michael Cera \\u2014 in a wonderful, insinuatingly creepy performance \\u2014 turns into a portrait of Hollywood entitlement and moral rot.It\\u2019s too bad there isn\\u2019t more of him in \\u201cMolly\\u2019s Game,\\u201d because, despite Ms. Chastain\\u2019s charisma and gift for delivering Mr. Sorkin\\u2019s fast talk, Molly isn\\u2019t interesting. Things happen to her, but most of the action and fun is at the table. Mr. Sorkin has written some sharp characters and cast them accordingly, tapping actors like Mr. Strong, Chris O\\u2019Dowd and a terrific Bill Camp, the protagonist in an affecting mini-tragedy in three acts (stoicism, disintegration and heartbreak). All the while, Molly smiles on the side, suffers a setback, moves to New York and racks up big money from card games that, at their best, turn into condensed pocket-size dramas, by turns triumphant and catastrophic.Mr. Sorkin tries to deepen Molly\\u2019s story and the stakes in several ways, partly through her legal troubles. Soon after the movie opens, the F.B.I. busts her, which leads her to Charlie Jaffey (Idris Elba), an expensive lawyer who becomes her passionate champion. This gives Mr. Sorkin a second line of action (and an office for discussions), allowing him to switch between Molly\\u2019s high-flying past (shuffle, deal, play) and her present-day troubles. As the story unfolds, the past catches up to the present and Mr. Sorkin keeps trying to invest Molly\\u2019s story with meaning, mostly through a little family psychodrama and some deeply unpersuasive feminism, including by casting her as a victim of men.It\\u2019s hard not to guffaw when, after Molly loses one game, she speaks of her \\u201cpowerlessness over the unfair whims of men.\\u201d But while it\\u2019s silly it\\u2019s also patronizing, because by attempting to portray Molly as any kind of female victim \\u2014 and by glossing over her culpability \\u2014 Mr. Sorkin only ends up denying this character her agency. Just as dubiously, when Molly is at her most vulnerable, he trots out a series of male authority figures, including her estranged father (Kevin Costner), who speak at and for her, who excuse her past, vouch for her character and enthuse about her future. They replace all the slick bros at the poker table and, taken together, make quite a paternal choir.It\\u2019s a striking progression for a movie that tries, altogether too feebly, to put a feminist spin on a woman who made bank through an illegal gambling ring. Empowerment is one way to look at this story, though only if you sentimentalize its main character. It is hard not to wonder how this movie might have turned out if Mr. Sorkin had decided his protagonist was as much a weasel as the one he wrote for \\u201cThe Social Network,\\u201d another story of an American striver.

       "  'text': u'Reynolds Woodcock, a couturier plying his trade in London in the 1950s, has a habit of sewing secret messages into his garments. (\\u201cNever cursed\\u201d is the blessing stitched in lavender thread that he slips into the hem of a wedding gown commissioned by a Middle Eastern princess.) These invisible traces of his hand \\u2014 hidden meanings in the literal sense \\u2014 signify that his dresses are more than luxurious commodities. They are works of art, obscurely and yet unmistakably saturated with the passion and personality of their creator.It hardly seems an accident that Paul Thomas Anderson has inscribed his monogram in the title of his eighth feature, \\u201cPhantom Thread,\\u201d which chronicles a few chapters in Reynolds\\u2019s fictional life and career. This is a profoundly, intensely, extravagantly personal film. I don\\u2019t mean autobiographical. I know little and care less about the details of Mr. Anderson\\u2019s personal life. Whether or not his longtime partner, the actress and comedian Maya Rudolph, has ever cooked him a mushroom omelet is a matter of complete indifference to me.Not every movie about an artist is a self-portrait of its director, but \\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d almost offhandedly lays out intriguing analogies between Reynolds\\u2019s m\\xe9tier and Mr. Anderson\\u2019s. The fashion designer, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, turns drawings into drama, manipulating color and movement and the human form to construct a material object that is also artificial, idealized and fantastical \\u2014 a commodity that impersonates a dream. He is assisted in his labor by a crew of disciplined artisans who cut and stitch his ideas into usable form. (This may be the place to note that the editor of \\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d is Dylan Tichenor. Mark Bridges designed the costumes. Mr. Anderson served as his own director of photography.)The result of this collective toil is a singular vessel for beauty and pleasure, subject to the whims of the market and the vagaries of taste and therefore easy to trivialize. It\\u2019s just a movie. It\\u2019s just a dress. When Reynolds\\u2019s sister and business partner, Cyril (Lesley Manville), informs him of the departure of a longtime client for a house she regards as more \\u201cchic,\\u201d the designer has a small tantrum. The word disgusts him, not least because it expresses the vulgarity of the environment in which he must pursue his lofty visions.That discrepancy \\u2014 between an exquisite sensibility and a world of grubby, shallow materialism \\u2014 may explain some of the temperamental quirks that Reynolds shares with his creator. Over the years, especially since \\u201cThere Will Be Blood,\\u201d Mr. Anderson has repeatedly manifested his indifference to the fashions and conventions of contemporary filmmaking. In particular, he disdains the careful, self-conscious husbanding of themes and messages that preoccupies many of his peers. He always seems more interested in what his movies are than in what they\\u2019re about or who they might be for.\\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d is not as hermetic as \\u201cThe Master\\u201d or as loosey-goosey as \\u201cInherent Vice.\\u201d It\\u2019s a chamber piece, romantic and baroque in equal measure, with arresting harmonies and ravishing changes of tone. (This might be the place to note that Jonny Greenwood composed the score). Like \\u201cThere Will Be Blood,\\u201d it casts Mr. Day-Lewis as an avatar of obsession, driven this time by the pursuit of aesthetic perfection rather than money and power. But whereas Daniel Plainview in the earlier film was a vector of pure, demonic ambition, Reynolds Woodcock bemusedly discovers himself to be one leg of a complicated emotional triangle.The other sides are Cyril and Alma (Vicky Krieps), a non-British waitress in a provincial British restaurant who becomes Reynolds\\u2019s model, mistress and muse. Usually this is a temporary assignment. We briefly meet Alma\\u2019s predecessor, Johanna (Camilla Rutherford), who annoys Reynolds at breakfast and is dismissed offscreen by Cyril, with one of Reynolds\\u2019s old dresses as a consolation prize. Johanna\\u2019s sin is to request some of her lover\\u2019s attention, a demand he regards as intrusive and distracting.That dynamic will repeat itself with Alma, who butters her toast too noisily, pours tea with too much splashing and boldly asserts her right to exist as something more than an ornament in the Woodcock household. The battle of wills that ensues \\u2014 a two-front war for Alma, who must contend with both Woodcock siblings \\u2014 is the film\\u2019s dramatic furnace and its comic engine. The three main performances are each as richly textured and subtly shaded as the clothes. Mr. Day-Lewis composes a symphony of moods: sardonic, melancholy, inspired, impatient. But he is matched by Ms. Krieps, an actress from Luxembourg as canny and unintimidated as Alma herself. Is this collaboration or competition? A tango or a tennis match? Whatever it is, this partnership is thrilling to watch: funny, wrenching, full of large and small surprises.The difference between melodrama and comedy is a matter of perspective. Alma, Cyril and Reynolds are all, in their various ways, supremely witty people, capable of underlining the absurdity of their situations with a well-arched eyebrow or a devastating remark. They are acutely sensitive as well. What is painful to them is sometimes funny to us. The reverse is also true.Like a garment that can be worn with the lining on the outside, \\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d reverses itself, almost imperceptibly flipping from Reynolds\\u2019s point of view to Alma\\u2019s and back again. She succumbs, at first, to what is most likely a well-practiced campaign of seduction: Reynolds flirts with her at breakfast, invites her to dinner, takes her back to his country house and sets about making her a dress. What she regards as her physical flaws \\u2014 small breasts, broad shoulders, wide hips \\u2014 he sees as signs of perfection. She is dazzled by his ability to be dazzled by her.But then, when the spell seems about to wear off, Alma refuses to let it. She rejects the shabby bargain Reynolds offers her, which demands the complete suppression of her will in exchange for his occasional recognition of her existence. \\u201cI live here,\\u201d she says to a client who might otherwise have assumed she was just another seamstress. She fights for her position in the household, trying to outmaneuver Cyril and to force Reynolds to recognize her as his equal. There is some temerity in this, and some novelty in the way Mr. Anderson depicts their relationship. The wives of artists in movies and literature tend to be doormats or helpmeets, and their psychic anguish and creative fire rarely move from background to center stage.Is Alma a feminist heroine? Some version of that question is likely to fuel more than a few post-screening arguments. Your answer may depend on what you think of the mushroom omelet that is the movie\\u2019s spoiler-proof surprise. There are other things to talk about. On first viewing, the captivating strangeness of the mood and the elegant threading of the plot are likely to hold your attention, but later you can go back to savor the lustrous colors, the fine-grained performances and the romantic mystery that holds the whole thing together.What kind of love story is \\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d? The wrenching tale of a woman\\u2019s love for a man and a man\\u2019s love for his work. A dry, comic study of the asymmetries and conflicts at the heart of a marriage. A refined gothic nightmare in the manner of Henry James. A perverse psychological fable of unchecked ego and unhinged desire. That\\u2019s a partial catalog, and one that can\\u2019t quite capture how bizarre this movie is. Or how bizarrely true to life \\u2014 to art, to love, to itself \\u2014 it feels.',\n",

Like most omnibus programs, the offerings are a mixed bag, but this year\\u2019s 16 titles showcase a gratifying range of styles and subjects, with work that includes veterans and newcomers, the experimental and the commercial.Some of the most innovative titles are among the shortest \\u2014 and Canadian \\u2014 like Steven Woloshen\\u2019s \\u201cCasino.\\u201d Scored to the Oscar Peterson Trio\\u2019s riff on \\u201cSomething\\u2019s Coming,\\u201d from \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d it conjures the frenzy of a night on the gambling floor in a four-minute swirl of color, evoking roulette wheels, slot machines and card games with an almost Abstract Expressionist simplicity of line. (While conventional animation involves photographing illustrations, Mr. Woloshen draws directly on strips of film.)The Montreal-based animator Alexanne Desrosiers\\u2019s offbeat \\u201cLes Abeilles Domestiques (Domestic Bees)\\u201d begins with an inset image of the Grim Reaper visiting an elderly couple, then unfolds outward, with multiplying, beehivelike panels, to form a cryptic split-screen mosaic of the life cycle. It\\u2019s proof that great animation doesn\\u2019t demand a certain medium or budget \\u2014 this two-minute short was made with commercially available computer software \\u2014 just a fresh vantage point. Given how busy each panel is, the movie demands viewing on a large, eye-filling screen, similar to the kind used at the 1967 Montreal Expo.One of the revivals, \\u201cHangman,\\u201d from 1964, was shown in school classrooms to provoke discussion. Paul Julian (a veteran of the Looney Tunes background team) and Les Goldman (who shared an Oscar with Chuck Jones in 1966 for \\u201cThe Dot and the Line\\u201d) employ creepily angular imagery to illustrate Maurice Ogden\\u2019s poem \\u201cThe Hangman,\\u201d a rhyming allegory about a town\\u2019s acquiescence to an executioner who keeps demanding victims for his gallows.The other older work in the program is \\u201cNext Door,\\u201d a 1990 student film from Pete Docter, of Pixar. \\u201cNext Door\\u201d anticipates the curmudgeon-moppet bonding of Mr. Docter\\u2019s great Oscar-winning film \\u201cUp\\u201d (2009), but it also finds this artist \\u2014 known for his computer animation \\u2014 working in a delightful hand-drawn style, with characters whose eyebrows are as expressive as their smiles.On the other hand, the former Disney animator Glen Keane\\u2019s draftsmanship, and a score rather recognizably by John Williams, don\\u2019t do enough to distinguish \\u201cDear Basketball,\\u201d a mawkish ode to hoop dreams created and narrated by Kobe Bryant, from the bland uplift of a Nike commercial. In voice-over, Mr. Bryant serenades his love of the sport from his time as a small boy, watching videos of the Los Angeles Lakers, to his retirement from that team in 2016.The Swedish artist Niki Lindroth von Bahr\\u2019s prizewinning \\u201cThe Burden,\\u201d set in a grim, anthropomorphized Nordic city filled with singing fish, simian telemarketers and tap-dancing mice, has been growing on me since it showed at Film Forum this fall.

       "  'text': u'Early in \\u201cThe Greatest Showman,\\u201d P.T. Barnum, played with gung-ho sincerity by Hugh Jackman, says he has long served up hokum, but now wants to do more for his audience: \\u201cJust once I\\u2019d like to give them something real.\\u201dWhat fun is that?Even after the long-running circus bearing his name closed up shop this year, P.T. Barnum remains firmly lodged in the public imagination because of his gift for blurring the line between truth and fiction. When he presented the 161-year-old nurse of George Washington as a star attraction, some of his audience knew she was phony, others did not, and then there were those who did not care and went along for the ride. There\\u2019s pleasure in a good fib (spoiler alert: Santa), as well as political advantage. When compared to Barnum last year, Donald Trump responded: \\u201cWe need P.T. Barnum, a little bit.\\u201d\\u201cThe Greatest Showman,\\u201d a montage sequence that occasionally turns into a movie musical, steers clear of any contemporary resonance and ignores meaty themes. The first-time director Michael Gracey achieves an aggressively synthetic style through kinetic editing and tidy underdog stories, but none of the true joy of pulling a fast one. It\\u2019s a standard-issue holiday biopic, one that tells a story about a populist entertainer hungry for highbrow respect, the joys of showbiz and the price of ambition. An amusement park version of P.T. Barnum is fine, as far as that goes, but if you are going to aim for family-friendly fun, you need to get the fun part right.\\u201cShowman\\u201d has the ingredients of a splashy good time, since it has the perfect star in Hugh Jackman, the most charismatic Broadway leading man of his generation; and songs by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the acclaimed duo behind the lyrics for last year\\u2019s hit movie \\u201cLa La Land\\u201d (which won them Oscars) and the music for the Broadway show \\u201cDear Evan Hansen\\u201d (which won them Tonys). But they are all awkward fits for this material. The songs, which shift from defiant pop anthems to melodramatic ballads, do not evoke the circus, or at least not the American version. Their soupy soulfulness belongs to Cirque du Soleil more than Ringling Brothers. And while Mr. Jackman is a dashing presence with an easy smile, his earnest performance could use a few knowing winks. The script doesn\\u2019t do him any favors. Its first joke is a spit-take, and it doesn\\u2019t get any wittier than that.Not much time is wasted on Barnum\\u2019s early life. Success comes quick, soon after making his American Museum, which mixes flea circuses and bearded ladies. Then Barnum starts chasing respectability, hiring an upper-crust playwright (a colorless Zac Efron), who falls in love with an acrobat (Zendaya), and presenting on tour the opera singer Jenny Lind (Rebecca Ferguson). His star attractions turn into a kind of chorus of eccentrics, with minimal back stories.Playing the role of a skeptical theater critic as the joyless foil to the giddy fun inspired by Barnum, Paul Sparks maintains a stern deadpan, the way reviewers in movies do. As Barnum\\u2019s wife, Charity, Michelle Williams gazes adoringly, until rumors in the press of his affair with Ms. Lind prompt her eyelids to fall in disappointment.The repercussions of this domestic drama are predictable, but at least they do lead to a delightful redemptive scene (one of the movie\\u2019s few pleasingly dreamlike moments), when Barnum uses an elephant as a New York taxi to make an appointment on time.

       "  'text': u'Steven Spielberg\\u2019s exhilarating drama \\u201cThe Post\\u201d is about a subject that\\u2019s dear to the heart of journalists: themselves! Set largely during a few anxious weeks in 1971, it revisits The Washington Post\\u2019s decision to publish portions of the Pentagon Papers, an immense classified report that chronicled America\\u2019s involvement in Southeast Asia from World War II to 1968. In Mr. Spielberg\\u2019s hands, that decision becomes a ticktock thriller about the freedom of the press, the White House\\u2019s war on that constitutional right and the middle-aged woman who defended freedom in a fabulous gold caftan.The real story began with Daniel Ellsberg, the Marine turned government researcher turned clandestine peacenik who first gave the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times. The Times began running portions on June 13, 1971. After the attorney general, John Mitchell, accused The Times of violating the Espionage Act, a judge ordered it to stop publishing the papers. At a pivotal time in American history, the government was preventing the press from getting the news out, on the grounds that it would do injury to national security. Shortly thereafter, The Post, which had been publishing rewrites of The Times\\u2019s articles, began running its own excerpts, becoming part of a Supreme Court showdown over the First Amendment.The Pentagon Papers give \\u201cThe Post\\u201d its heft and pulse; the antagonism between the government and the media gives it a shiver of topicality. Even so, shaping a drama around a newspaper that didn\\u2019t break the story seems an odd path to Hollywood triumphalism, though the scrappy Post was itching to be a national player. There\\u2019s also the matter of the actual import of the Pentagon Papers. In his memoir, Ben Bradlee, The Post\\u2019s longtime editor \\u2014 winningly played by Tom Hanks with macho suavity and an on-and-off Boston accent \\u2014 devotes four times as much space to Watergate (a story that his paper did break) as to the Pentagon Papers. Except that \\u201cThe Post\\u201d cares less about the hard-charging Bradlee than it does his boss, Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep), the paper\\u2019s late-blooming publisher.The story opens in 1966 with Daniel Ellsberg (Matthew Rhys), a government analyst on a data-mining mission in Vietnam, pecking out reports on his portable typewriter amid exploding bombs and flowing blood. The secretary of defense, Robert McNamara (Bruce Greenwood, wearing a frozen smile and an oil slick of hair), thinks the war is going badly but grossly mischaracterizes American progress to journalists. Disillusioned with the official script, Daniel eventually goes cloak-and-dagger rogue and is on his way to publicizing the Pentagon Papers, a momentous decision that Mr. Spielberg enlivens with spooky shadows and what may be the most nervous-making photocopying in film history.The story soon jumps to Katharine, jolting out of a slumber, a sly preview of larger awakenings to come, both her own and that of the country. She\\u2019s about to take her company public, a move that she and a close adviser (Tracy Letts, wry and tart) hope will financially stabilize it. During the week that this business is finalized, though, the company will be temporarily vulnerable to its underwriters. The stock offering, Graham writes in her memoir, was scheduled for June 15. Two days, later, The Post had the Pentagon Papers. What happened next is a matter of record, history being the ultimate spoiler. The pleasure of \\u201cThe Post\\u201d is how it sweeps you up in how it all went down.Mostly, it went down fast, a pace that Mr. Spielberg conveys with accelerated rhythms, flying feet, racing cameras and an enjoyably loose approach to the material. With his virtuosic, veteran crew, Mr. Spielberg paints the scene vividly and with daubs of beauty; most notably, he creates distinct visual realms for the story\\u2019s two main overlapping, at times colliding worlds. Katharine reigns over one; at first she\\u2019s all but entombed in her darkly lighted, wood-paneled empire. Ben rules the other, overseeing the talking and typing warriors of the glaring, noisily freewheeling newsroom. (The costume designer Ann Roth subtly brightens Katharine, taking her from leaden gray to free-flowing gold.)Just as Daniel will come into consciousness so will Katharine, a twinned metamorphosis that, in turn, speaks to the larger cultural and social changes shaking the country. Time and again, men crowd over and around Katharine, walking in front of her, speaking for her. As the drama heats up, the typewriters furiously clack \\u2014 and the political becomes increasingly personal, and the personal turns political \\u2014 Katharine finds both a new purpose and identity. With small tilts of her head, darting looks, nervous flutters and a Brahmin imperiousness that gradually eases and warms, Ms. Streep creates an acutely moving portrait of a woman who in liberating herself helps instigate a revolution.Like many movies that turn the past into entertainment, \\u201cThe Post\\u201d gently traces the arc of history, while also bending it for dramatic punch and narrative expediency. The filmmakers fold in atmospheric true-to-life details, like the poster for the western film \\u201cButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\u201d (a favorite of the real Mr. Ellsberg) that Daniel and some longhair pals sweep past on their way to illegally copying the Pentagon Papers. And while it\\u2019s no surprise that the movie omits and elides important players and crucial episodes, its honed focus jibes with the view of the former New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, who wrote that the \\u201cpublic disclosure of the Pentagon Papers challenged the core of a president\\u2019s power: his role in foreign and national security affairs.\\u201dThat challenge becomes the movie\\u2019s cri de coeur, its reason for being. And, as that challenge becomes a crusade, it leads to some lump-in-the-throat grandstanding about the press and its relationship to power. Ben and Katharine each have friends in high government places. These allegiances \\u2014 to friends, to state authority \\u2014 are tested by the Pentagon Papers, if rather more tested, perhaps, for the purposes of this fiction. Graham\\u2019s husband, Phil, and Bradlee were both close with John F. Kennedy. In her memoirs, Graham writes that her friend McNamara helpfully advised The Times on a legally sensitive letter about the Pentagon Papers, a detail that underscores the depth of these powerful allegiances.The Pentagon Papers \\u2014 officially titled \\u201cReport of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force\\u201d \\u2014 is an encyclopedia of outrageous decisions and acts, what Mr. Ellsberg once described as \\u201cevidence of lying, by four presidents and their administrations over twenty-three years, to conceal plans and actions of mass murder.\\u201d Mr. Ellsberg didn\\u2019t stop the war, but he did assert our right, and obligation, to challenge absolute power. That may be why the filmmakers \\u2014 the script is by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer \\u2014 slip in a bit from a speech that Mario Savio delivered two years before \\u201cThe Post\\u201d opens and which memorably asserts: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can\\u2019t take part!\\u201dThere\\u2019s more than a little corn and wishful thinking in the high-minded moments in \\u201cThe Post\\u201d; movies like either to glorify or demonize journalists, relying on heroes and villains. Yet given the recent assaults on journalism and the truth, this heroizing is also irresistible. And Mr. Spielberg, a shrewd entertainer who can be waylaid by moralism, rarely lets virtue drag this movie down. He lightens the heaviness with humor, physical comedy (fumbling, stumbling) and a perfectly synced cast that includes the funnymen David Cross, Zach Woods and a terrific Bob Odenkirk. As a filmmaker, Mr. Spielberg invariably comes down on the side of optimism; here, that hopefulness feels right. It also feels like a rallying cry.',\n",
